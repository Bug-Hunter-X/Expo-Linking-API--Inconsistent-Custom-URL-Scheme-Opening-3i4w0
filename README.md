This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo's Linking API related to opening custom URL schemes. The bug manifests as inconsistent behavior: the URL may open successfully some times, while at other times the operation fails silently. The lack of error messages and inconsistent reproduction makes this bug particularly challenging to diagnose and resolve.  The solution explores workarounds to increase reliability and provide better feedback to the user.
